# SEO Content Strategy Frameworks

This repository documents practical frameworks for building topical authority through SEO content.

It is not a collection of blog posts or tutorials.
It is a system-level overview of how content should be planned, structured, and connected to rank sustainably.

## What This Repository Covers

- Topic cluster architecture
- SERP-based content gap analysis
- SEO content production workflows
- Internal linking logic for authority building

These frameworks are based on real-world implementation across long-term SEO projects.

## Core Principles

- Content should be structured, not random
- SERPs define intent, not keyword tools
- Authority is built through coverage, not volume
- Internal links are strategic assets, not navigation

## Who This Is For

- SEO strategists
- Content leads
- Founders building organic authority
- Writers working within structured SEO systems

## Disclaimer

These frameworks focus on *how to think* about SEO content systems.
They are not quick wins, hacks, or templates.
