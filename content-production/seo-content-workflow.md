# SEO Content Production Workflow

SEO content should follow a predictable system.

## Workflow

1. SERP analysis
2. Intent classification
3. Content brief creation
4. Writing
5. Internal linking
6. Publishing
7. Indexing
8. Performance review

## Key Principle

Publishing without architecture leads to fragmentation.
Consistency beats velocity.
