# SERP Content Gap Framework

Content gaps are identified by analyzing what ranking pages fail to address.

## Process

1. Identify ranking URLs for a target query
2. Analyze content types and formats
3. Identify missing angles:
   - definitions
   - examples
   - frameworks
   - decision criteria
4. Match gaps to search intent

## Key Insight

Content gaps are not keyword gaps.
They are *expectation gaps* based on SERP behavior.

## Use Case

This framework is used to:
- decide what content to create
- improve existing articles
- avoid publishing redundant pages
