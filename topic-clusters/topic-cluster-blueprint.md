# Topic Cluster Blueprint

A topic cluster is a structured group of pages built around a central pillar topic.

## Components

1. Pillar Page  
   - Broad coverage
   - Commercial or strategic intent
   - Central authority signal

2. Cluster Content  
   - Narrow subtopics
   - Intent-specific
   - Supports the pillar

3. Internal Linking  
   - Cluster → Pillar
   - Pillar → Key clusters
   - Logical cross-links between related topics

## Strategic Rules

- One pillar per core topic
- Minimum 10 supporting articles
- No overlapping intent
- No competing URLs

## Outcome

Proper topic clusters help search engines understand:
- topical depth
- authority boundaries
- relevance relationships
